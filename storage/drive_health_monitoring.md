# Drive health monitoring
Quick setup instructions for monitoring the health of drives (e.g., spinning rust).  (Debian 11).

# Depenencies
As root:
    apt install smartmontools
    
# Checking for SMART capabilties
Identify the drive to check with `lsblk`.
Check for SMART support with `/sbin/smartctl -i /dev/sdX | grep support`.

# Configuration
These steps assume notification email support has been configured on the machine (e.g. msmtp).

Replace the DEVICESCAN line in /etc/smartd.conf, explicitly adding the drives that should be monitored.
Replace the default `-m root` to `-m desiredemailuser@desiredemaildomain.tld` to enable email monitoring.

Examples (this example schedules an Offline Immediate Test on Saturday at 1am, see ```man smartd.conf``` for more options):

    /dev/sdb -d removable -n standby -H -l error -l selftest -f -s (O/../../6/1) -m desiredemailuser@desiredemaildomain.tld -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner
    /dev/sdc -d removable -n standby -H -l error -l selftest -f -s (O/../../6/1) -m desiredemailuser@desiredemaildomain.tld -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner

    
If SMART monitoring within a virtual machine (e.g., USB drive passthrough, or SATA controller passthrough), modify /etc/systemd/system/smartd.service, commenting out the line ```# ConditionVirtualization=no``` to allow SMART monitoring within virtual machines (e.g. with device passthrough), and inform systemd with ```systemctl daemon-reload```. 


# Testing
Modify the DEVICESCAN line in /etc/smartd.conf to include `-M test` at the end of the line, and restart the daemon to test.

    systemctl restart smartmontools

Remove when successful email notification is received, and restart smartmontools again.

# For eMMC
Can check with the `mmc` util, or with the kernel's sysfs interface.
(from https://www.toomanyatoms.com/computer/eMMC_health.html)

Debian:
```
apt install mmc-utils
```

RHEL/fedora:
```
dnf install mmc-utils
```

Check for `mmcblk0`:
```
mmc extcsd read /dev/mmcblk0
...
eMMC Life Time Estimation A [EXT_CSD_DEVICE_LIFE_TIME_EST_TYP_A]: 0x01
eMMC Life Time Estimation B [EXT_CSD_DEVICE_LIFE_TIME_EST_TYP_B]: 0x01
```

A is for SLC and B is for MLC. If eMMC is TLC, see B.

The value begins at 0x01 and increases by 1 for every 10% of its lifetime used, and will be 0x0b after 100%. Thereâ€™s also:

```
eMMC Pre EOL information [EXT_CSD_PRE_EOL_INFO]: 0x01
```

The EOL information is an overall status for reserved blocks, given as follows:

- 0x00 = Not defined
- 0x01 = Normal: consumed less than 80% of the reserved blocks
- 0x02 = Warning: consumed 80% of the reserved blocks
- 0x03 = Urgent: consumed 90% of the reserved blocks
